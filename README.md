# KID for PRIIPs

In the PRIIPs (Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products) regulation of the European Union (No. 1286/2014) the KID (Key Information Document) is defined as a measure to improve investor protection. The document specified in the regulation consists of at most three pages presenting the details of a financial product, a risk indicator, different scenarios for the behavior of the product over time, as well a disclosure of the costs inherent to the product. In the [annexes](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017R0653) the exact form of the document and the calculation methodologies are specified.

# Architecture

## Calculations / Simulations

We implement the calculations/simulations for Category 2 and 3 KIDs. These are based on the following methodologies, resp. algorithms:

* Cornish Fisher expansion
* Monte-Carlo simulations

The GPU-based Monte-Carlo simulation framework is implemented in the programming language [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org)

The implementation is done the repository [kid-annexes](https://github.com/monoid-gmbh/kid-annexes).

### Payoff Language

A generic, certified payoff language has been proposed in the following paper:

Danil Annenkov and Martin Elsman. Certified Compilation of Financial Contracts. In Proceedings of the 20th International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDPâ€™18). Frankfurt am Main, Germany. September 2018. [PDF](http://hiperfit.dk/pdf/annenkov-elsman-ppdp18.pdf)

The proposed language allows to generate payoff functions in [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org) that run on the GPU-based simulation engine for the KID calculations.

### Historical data

Historical data is loaded from [Quandl](http://quandl.com). In order to use the Quandl API without restrictions, an API key has to be provided.

## Document generation

The documents are generated using LaTeX that are then compiled to a PDF document.

## Building the project

### Compile

```
$ cabal build
```

### Run the application server

The application server is started as follows. Optinally provide the Quandl API key on the command-line:

```
$ cabal run kid-exe -- -k <quandl-key>
```

Sample request:

```
$ curl -X POST --data '@test/example/contract.json' -H 'Accept: application/pdf' -H 'Content-type: application/json' -o kid.pdf http://localhost:8081/kid?lang=EN
```
